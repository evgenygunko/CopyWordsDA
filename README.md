# CopyWords

CopyWords is a simple dictionary app for looking up Danish or Spanish words.
It provides quick access to translations, pronunciation, and sound files - all in one place.

While CopyWords was originally created to help with [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) flashcards, the **dictionary mode** makes it useful even if you only want to look up words and hear how they sound.

If you’re interested in using CopyWords together with Anki, see the [Copy Mode documentation](./README_COPY_MODE.md).

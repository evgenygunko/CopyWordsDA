# Copy Mode and Anki Integration

CopyWords was originally created to make it easier to add new Danish or Spanish words to the [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) flashcard system.
In **Copy Mode**, the app automatically extracts word details from online dictionaries so you can quickly copy them into your Anki cards.

## How to Use Copy Mode

1. Select the source language.
2. Type a word (or part of it) in the **Search** box and click **Search**.
3. If the word exists in the online dictionary, its details will be parsed and displayed.
4. Use the **Copy** buttons to copy the relevant text to the clipboard.
5. Paste the text into the Anki card editor.

**Note:**
The screenshot is taken on Windows, as it is easier to copy different parts of a word there.
On Android, you can copy the **front** and **back** fields.
